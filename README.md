Learning how to use GitHub!

Making my first GitHub account so I can manage code files between me and my peers while we work on projects together. Tennis and Rock Climbing are a couple of my favarite activities, but recently I haven't had time to do either of them. Maybe using Github instead of fumbling around with copies of files appended with "new," "final," and "newfinal," strewn between email and Google Drive will boost my productivity, saving me time and giving me the opportunity to get out on the Tennis court or out to the crag more often.
